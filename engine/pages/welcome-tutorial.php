				<h5>Learn Infinity Engine!</h5>
				<p>
					Infinity Engine was made to develop applications on the web.
					It's sole purpose is to present data in manageable, secure, 
					and stylish manner with more focus on usability and practical
					applications. We have included many features that allow developers
					to create their custom applications which can be included in
					the system very easily. Moreover we have abstracted the data layer
					to the themes themselves i.e. the types of pages you create are
					dependent on the theme itself.
